Hi there! I'm a high school developer crafting code with bubble tea in one hand 🧋 and curiosity in the other.

My keyboard is a magic wand 🪄 – every commit is a spell to build friendlier digital realms. When I'm not battling math problems, you'll find me whispering to Bash scripts and coaxing APIs into friendship.

Like my work? Let's connect and build something star-worthy! ✨
